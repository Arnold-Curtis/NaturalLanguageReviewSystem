# The Main Class 

Alright, friends! Buckle up because we're about to dive into the heart of this Java application. The `Main` class is where the magic happens.

Let's start with the `main` method, the entrance to our application. This kicks things off by launching the JavaFX application.

Now, the `start` method is where everything begins. It's like the grand opening ceremony, setting the stage for our application's user interface. Here's how it goes down:

1. We create an instance of the `Stage` class, which is essentially the window where our application will live and breathe.

2. Next, we load the `LoginPage.fxml` file, which contains the layout and design for our login screen. It's like the bouncer at a fancy club, making sure only the cool kids (with valid credentials) get in.

3. After loading the login screen, we create a new `Scene` object, which is the canvas where our UI elements will be painted. It's like the stage at a concert, where the performers (our UI components) will strut their stuff.

4. We set the title of our stage to "Login Page" because, well, that's what it is! Nothing fancy, just keeping it real.

5. We assign the newly created `Scene` to our `Stage` object, essentially setting the backdrop for our application.

6. Finally, we call the `show` method on our `Stage`, unveiling our application to the world like a grand unveiling ceremony. Ta-da! ðŸŽ‰

#NaturalLanguageAnalyzer



### 1. **Class Overview**:
- The `NaturalLanguageAnalyzer` class is responsible for analyzing the sentiment of textual reviews.
- It utilizes Stanford's CoreNLP library to tokenize, split sentences, parse, and analyze sentiment.

### 2. **Dependencies**:
- This class relies on the `edu.stanford.nlp` package, which contains classes and tools for natural language processing tasks.

### 3. **Static Initialization**:
- The `pipeline` object of type `StanfordCoreNLP` is initialized in a static block using a set of properties. These properties configure the pipeline to perform various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis Method**:
- The `analyzeSentiment(String reviewText)` method accepts a `String` parameter representing the review text to be analyzed.
- It processes the text through the CoreNLP pipeline, annotating each sentence with sentiment information.
- The method then calculates a sentiment score for each sentence based on its sentiment class (e.g., "Positive", "Negative").
- Sentiment scores for individual sentences are aggregated and averaged to produce an overall sentiment score for the entire review text.
- The sentiment score is returned as an integer, with a range from 1 to 9, where:
  - 1 indicates a very negative sentiment.
  - 9 indicates a very positive sentiment.
  - 5 indicates a neutral sentiment.
- The method handles cases where the review text is null or empty by returning a neutral score of 5.

### 5. **Private Helper Method**:
- The `getSentimentScore(String sentiment)` method maps sentiment classes obtained from CoreNLP to sentiment scores.
- It returns an integer score based on the sentiment class provided. This mapping allows for a consistent scoring system across different sentiment classes.

### 6. **Usage**:
- To use this class, simply create an instance of `NaturalLanguageAnalyzer` and call its `analyzeSentiment` method with the text you want to analyze.
- The method will return an integer score representing the sentiment of the text.

### 7. **Flexibility and Extensibility**:
- This class provides flexibility by allowing the user to analyze the sentiment of any textual content.
- It can be extended to support additional NLP tasks or to customize sentiment scoring based on specific requirements.

### 8. **Performance Considerations**:
- The static initialization of the CoreNLP pipeline ensures efficiency by reusing the pipeline across multiple method invocations, which can be beneficial for performance-sensitive applications.
- However, it's essential to consider the overhead associated with initializing the pipeline, especially in applications where sentiment analysis is performed frequently.

### 9. **Error Handling**:
- The class handles potential errors, such as database connection failures or unexpected SQL exceptions, by printing error messages to the console. However, it might be beneficial to implement more robust error handling mechanisms, such as logging or exception propagation, in production-grade applications.

Overall, the `NaturalLanguageAnalyzer` class provides a robust and efficient solution for sentiment analysis, leveraging Stanford's CoreNLP library to process textual data and derive meaningful sentiment scores.
